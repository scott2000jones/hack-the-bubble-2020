### ideas
- spooky theme
- text based game
- ai-generated npc lines?
- about the spookiness of submitting a practical?

### storyline
- it's 8:30pm and you are about to submit your practical but your laptop dies
- you need to go to the labs
- it is dark and rainy
- you see spooky things along the long dra path
- when you finally get to the labs, you struggle a lot with the door because its difficult to open after 5pm
- etc
